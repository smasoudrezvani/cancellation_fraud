### Overview of the Imported Libraries and Initial Setup
- Essential libraries are imported for handling imbalanced datasets, building machine learning pipelines, and generating interactive plots.
- **Key Libraries**: `imblearn` (e.g., SMOTE, ADASYN) for oversampling; Plotly for interactive plots.
- Configurations include setting a random seed for reproducibility and ensuring full visibility of DataFrames.

### Explanation of Model Hyperparameter Grids
- Hyperparameter grids are defined for various classifiers like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Random Forest**: Parameters like maximum depth and feature selection methods are explored.
- **SVM**: Both linear and RBF kernels are considered with varying regularization strengths.
- **KNN**: Focuses on the number of neighbors and distance metrics to optimize model performance.

### Importing and Cleaning the Dataset
- Outlier detection and removal are done using Z-scores, where data points that deviate by more than three standard deviations are eliminated.

### Dendrogram Visualization
- A dendrogram is generated to visualize the hierarchical clustering of dataset features based on their correlations.

With this summary in mind, here's a README that you can use for your GitHub repository:

# Cancellation Fraud Detection in Ride-Hailing Services Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fraudulent behavior in ride-hailing services, where drivers accept trips but cancel them to avoid paying commission. The notebook leverages machine learning techniques to identify such drivers.

## Overview

The project employs a variety of machine learning algorithms to predict fraudulent trip cancellations. We address the imbalanced dataset problem and apply techniques such as oversampling and detailed hyperparameter tuning.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE and ADASYN.
2. **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Several classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, and KNN are tuned using grid search.
3. **Outlier Detection**: Z-score based filtering is applied to remove extreme values from the dataset.
4. **Feature Correlation**: A dendrogram is used to visualize hierarchical clustering of dataset features.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `scikit-learn`
- `imblearn`
- `pandas`
- `plotly`
- `matplotlib`
